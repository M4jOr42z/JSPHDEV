“Don’t worry about failure; you only have to be right once.”

“Instead of trying to make your life perfect, give yourself the freedom to make it an adventure, and go ever upward.”

“The hardest-working people don’t work hard because they’re disciplined. They work hard because working on an exciting problem is fun.”

“Surrounding yourself with inspiring people is now just as important as being talented or working hard.”
